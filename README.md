# Python Blackjack

This repository holds my second project from Jose Portilla's "Complete Python Bootcamp" on Udemy â€“ it is a game of blackjack with an automated dealer, played from the console. The AI who deals the cards goes by Mzank, uses they/them/theirs, and prefers the term "animunculus."

## How to Play

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed, e.g. via Anaconda.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Wherever you have this repository saved, run python blackjack.py on your console of choice.
