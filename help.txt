Before each round of Blackjack, you will be asked how much of your money you
want to bet. You can input any dollar amount, with or without a dollar sign or
decimal places. If you win that round, your bet will be doubled; if you lose, it
will be lost. Ties will simply return your money.

At the start of each round you will draw two cards: you can opt to draw another,
or to stick with what you have. Your goal is to build a hand of a value as close
as possible to 21 without going over, i.e. without busting. Aces have a value of
11, unless that would cause you to go over 21, in which case as many aces are
reduces to their "soft" value of 1 as is necessary to bring you under 21. Face
cards (e.g. the jack or king) are worth 10 points.

To draw another card, type any of:
    - Hit
    - Hit me
    - Hit me, baby, one more time

To stop building your hand, type any of:
    - Stand
    - I stand
    - Would the real Jim Shady please stand up?

If your hand is more valuable than what the dealer is able to build (the dealer
will alwys stand on a value of 17 or greater), then you will win the round. If
you bust but the dealer does not, you lose. If you the dealer busts and you
don't you win. If both of you bust, a tie is called.

Additionally, there is the conditon of blackjack: when someone draws an initial
two-card hand worth exactly 21 points. If you draw a blackjack hand, then you
will immediately win, unless the dealer also draws a blackjack, in which case
you will lose.

After each round you will prompted on whether you wish to continue playing.

Any time you are asked for input, type "help" to bring up this information agin.
